# 🚲 US Bike Share Data Analysis Project

This project explores data from the US bike share systems in **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington, D.C.** using Python. It was completed as part of the Data Science learning path to demonstrate data analysis skills using **pandas**, **NumPy**, and basic Python programming.

## 📊 Project Summary

The goal is to analyze usage patterns of bike-sharing services in three major cities and extract insights such as:
- Most common travel times
- Most popular stations
- Average trip duration
- User demographics and types

This project involves loading CSV data, applying filters (by city, month, and day), and calculating statistical summaries.
